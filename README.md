# Express Open Architecture

`fp-express` is a library designed to enable the writing of Express servers in a purely functional style using `fp-ts`. This library includes both the core library itself and an example project named `app1`. The example project demonstrates canonical usage of the library, including the creation of Express endpoints and connecting to two different databases: `SQLite` and `Redis`.

## Features

- Write Express servers in a purely functional style
- Utilize `fp-ts` for functional programming constructs
- Example project `app1` showcasing best practices
- Demonstrates separation of concerns, modularity, and reusability
- Fail-tolerant code design

## Example Project: app1

The `app1` project included in this repository serves as a comprehensive example of how to use `fp-express`. It includes:

- Creation of `Express` endpoints
- Connection to `SQLite` and `Redis` databases
- Implementation of functional programming best practices
